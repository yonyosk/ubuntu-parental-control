# Enhanced Blocked Website Pages - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This project aims to transform the user experience when websites are blocked by Ubuntu Parental Control. Currently, users encounter generic browser error messages stating "website can't be accessed due to network issues." This creates confusion and provides no educational value or clarity about why access was restricted.

The enhanced blocked page system will provide:
- Clear, informative explanations for why sites are blocked
- Age-appropriate, visually appealing designs
- Interactive features for requesting temporary access
- Educational content about digital wellness
- Customization options for parents

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Poor User Experience**: Users see misleading browser error messages instead of clear blocking notifications
2. **No Context**: No explanation provided for why a site is blocked
3. **Confusion**: Error messages suggest network problems rather than intentional blocking
4. **Missed Educational Opportunity**: No chance to educate users about digital wellness
5. **Inflexible**: Parents cannot customize messages or provide context
6. **Technical Issues**: Blocking server may not be reliably running

### Impact
- Users feel frustrated and confused
- Parents receive unnecessary support requests
- The parental control appears broken or malfunctioning
- No opportunity for teaching moments about safe internet use
