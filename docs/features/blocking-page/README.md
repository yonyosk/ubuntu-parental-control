# Enhanced Blocked Website Pages - Project Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive planning documents for developing enhanced, nicely designed blocked website pages for Ubuntu Parental Control.

**Current State**: Users encountering blocked websites see generic browser error messages stating the website cannot be accessed due to network issues.

**Goal**: Replace error messages with informative, educational, and visually appealing blocked pages that explain why sites are blocked and provide interactive features.
